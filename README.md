**_FullStack developer_**

   I'm engineer with more than 10 years experiences in Web-based technologies, methodologies and best practices, information systems design patterns, UI/UX design, management and support processes of the complex programs developing. Due to the strong emotional burnout and living circumstances I have been forced to get the extended time-out in commercial development and change my occupation to non-relevant.
   Currently I'm educating myself in a modern Web development trying to restore both my soft and hard skills, redefining and improving the understanding of the prior work experience. My goal is to grok the Ruby&RoR \+ React engineering processes and get an offer for the full stack developer position in the short run.
