**_FullStack developer_**

   I'm engineer with more than 10 years experiences in Web-based technologies, methodologies and best practices, information systems design patterns, UI/UX design, management and support processes of the complex programs developing. Due to the strong emotional burnout and living circumstances I have been forced to get the extended time-out in commercial development and change my occupation to non-relevant.
   Currently I'm educating myself in a modern Web development trying to restore both my soft and hard skills, redefining and improving the understanding of the prior work experience. My goal is to grok the Ruby&RoR \+ React engineering processes and get an offer for the full stack developer position in the short run.

## Work experience

- [January 2020 - August 2022]: **Non-relevant experience in agriculture business**, LED lights researching, etc. Mastered in Soil, DWC, DWL plant growing, processes automatization, etc. Learned the science approaches of the physiology of the plants, growing technologies, schemes and specific feeding profiles by myself with no educational courses or help. So it was not only the self-motivated and practical way to overcome my impostor syndrome but the usefull biological engineering skills from scratch to the professional laboratory researching experience. I learned how to produce a feeding solution using simple salts from a public pharmacy for almost any crop or exotic fruit in any climatic zone of the globe and get the organoleptically ideal, strong and healfy product. Due to the situation in the world and the lack of investment I had to close existing projects in this area. Such a masterly success and an unexpected conclusion in a completely new field of activity pushed me to the idea of returning to the IT profession, became the motivation to review the past experience, learn hard-skills in the modern world of Web technologies and the inspiration to resume my career, but already in the role of a practicing developer.

- [December 2014 - January 2020]: **Periodical experiences in project development and management, audit and consulting services**. I have been working with Small-to-Medium businesses, creating project documentation and terms of reference, project cost estimates or even public offer statements on the site if needed, providing my clients with audits of various project aspects and understanding of the most efficient, secure and cost-effective practices of creating and supporting applications on Web. For example, I designed the business conception and developed the simple **HTML/CSS/Bootstrap3/JavaScript** version of the ulbibl.ru website for the local non-profit book-crossing and public library company using **Digital Ocean services**, some **3rd party widgets** and **SSL auto-renewing** with free **TLS certificate from LetsEncrypt**. 
   Another experience as a senior project manager role was in creating business processes conception and management system implementation for for federal micro finance company "Bystrodengi" LLC. I forced the moving of Dev/QA/Analytics staff communications from personal papers, messengers and mails to Jira Atlassian and configured the basic processes to make the specialists working in a Agile/Kanban methodology providing necessary professional development courses sometimes by complicated negotiations with the company top management. I performed the analysis of the company Web-development segments, in particular: both in-house and outsource development and processes, customer/staff support request management systems, other B2B/B2C applications and the departments performance review all the way down.

Planning and allocating resources on projects, project managers and developers team of the company's branch in Ulyanovsk, meeting deadlines and timelines on a project. Designing the applications from short description with user stories or sometimes performing the required analisys of the old software interfaces and base with a team and then produced the necessary documentation to confirm project estimate. I was developing the new application architecture and UI/UX using sketches, UML (mix of ER-, Class- and actors cases diagrams) by myself and only then confirm the requirements with developers team. So my job duties were not only the traditional managment but also business analytics, UX/UI prototyping and designing of all application approaches. As a technical manager I was assisting the account managers and product owners to handle with issues, resolving them and negotiating with customers and VIP clients, federal business representatives, for example, from Rostelecom, the Olympic Committee of the London 2012 and Sochi 2014 Olympics, Sheremetyevo airport, TechCrunch Moscow 2012-2013, HSBC bank in London. Have launched more than 10 public and even more in-house projects: mostly complex tech-based business applications based on **Ruby, RubyOnRails, Node.JS,  React, Angular, Backbone and other technologies**, DevOps projects with **Redis, MongoDB, Cheff/Ansible+Vagrant**, supervised projects like the GitLab and Redmine integration and implementation. I was involved in creating an engineering culture, trained new employees in the basics of Web application development, hired and performed a lot of work in personal motivation and improving the soft skills of my subordinate employees.

- [December 2009 - December 2011]: **Head of user support department, QA at Baby.ru**. I was engaged in quality assurance on the project, manual testing of releases. Trained developers in best-practices of product design, integration and delivery, releases engineering, implementing necessary tools and practices.

It was the most complex system in my career ever. The unique **Erlang/Ocaml/C++** code of platform allowed to process several billion requests per second, the best real-time rates at the time.
