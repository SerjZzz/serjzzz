# Sergey Zavolzhskiy

## Software backend engineer

I'm engineer with more than **10 years experiences** in Web-based technologies, methodologies, information systems design patterns, UI/UX design, management and support of the complex software development. After working as a technical project manager, due to the living circumstances I have been forced to get the extended time-out in commercial development and change my occupation to non-relevant.

Currently I'm educating myself trying to regain both my soft and hard skills, redefining of the prior work experience and improving the hands-on skills in modern Web technologies.

My goal is to grok the **Golang** engineering processes and get a job offer for the backend software developer position in the short run.

## Previous IT work background

- [December 2014 - August 2022]: **Periodical experiences in project development and management, audit and consulting services**. I have been **working with Small-to-Medium businesses**, creating project documentation and terms of reference, project cost estimates or even public offer statements on the site if needed, providing my clients with audits of various project aspects and understanding of the most efficient, secure and cost-effective practices of creating and supporting applications on Web. 
   - Designed some business conceptions and developed the simple websites with **HTML/CSS/Bootstrap3/JavaScript** using **Digital Ocean services**, some **3rd party widgets** and **SSL auto-renewing** with free **TLS certificate from LetsEncrypt**. One of them was ulbibl.ru, the local non-profit book-crossing and public library company. Another project was concept development, website design, development of the website itself for the leading construction company of the city - stroy-invest73.ru. It was a simple HTML/CSS/Javascript website with 3rd party widgets for forms of feedback, confirmation of user agreements and offer. The design and, for example, the step plan of the house, apartment layouts were also developed by me.
   - I **wrote and translated technical articles** for large social projects. For example, I was working at [Tproger.ru](tproger.ru) as a technical articles writer for several months. After I studied the product from the technical side, I became the **developer and site administrator**. Slightly improved the loading speed of the main **Wordpress** site, using classic techniques - **serverside, frontend optimizations, cdn**, and tests (Pagespeed Insight from Google, Web page test, gtmetrix). Removed broken links from homepage, optimized image quality, replaced image loading by sprites somewhere. Optimized loading speed of main pages: automatic concatenation and minification of **CSS/Javascript** files, tuned **gzip for fat Javascript** files on the server, cleaned head from garbage, removed blocking requests and sent some to the lazy load. Disabled a bunch of garbage **Wordpress plugins** or replaced them with more efficient solutions. Audited **production server** and fixed critical **security problems** (unnecessary redirects, file permissions, bad SSL certificate settings). Cleaned up **nginx** and configs from unnecessary garbage and raised the TTFB score to an acceptable level. Configured **Cloudflare CDN** so that the site was cached and was always available to users. I hooked up **CloudFlare Railgun**, connected **Newrelic** and configured the gathering of statistics for analyzing the peak loads on the site. Installed Rocket Loader from the same CloudFlare for optimizing the loading of static content.  Audited the site in other components and prepared an action plan. For example, a list of optimizations, which included upgrading **MySQL/PHP** and solving the problem of fat queries in the database and the elimination of the so-called spaghetti in the code. 
   - **Lead technical project manager**. Another experience as a senior project manager role was in creating business processes conception and management system implementation for for federal micro finance company "Bystrodengi" LLC. I forced the moving of Dev/QA/Analytics staff communications from personal papers, messengers and mails to Jira Atlassian and configured the basic processes to make the specialists working in a Agile/Kanban methodology providing necessary professional development courses sometimes by complicated negotiations with the company top management. I performed the analysis of the company Web-development segments, in particular: both in-house and outsource development and processes, customer/staff support request management systems, other B2B/B2C applications and the departments performance review all the way down.
   - **Non-relevant experience in agriculture business**, LED lights researching, etc. Mastered in Soil, DWC, DWL plant growing, processes automatization, etc. Learned the science approaches of the physiology of the plants, growing technologies, schemes and specific feeding profiles by myself with no educational courses or help. So it was not only the self-motivated and practical way to overcome my impostor syndrome but the usefull biological engineering skills from scratch to the professional laboratory researching experience. I learned how to produce a feeding solution using simple salts from a public pharmacy for almost any crop or exotic fruit in any climatic zone of the globe and get the organoleptically ideal, strong and healfy product. Due to the situation in the world and the lack of investment I had to close existing projects in this area. Such a masterly success and an unexpected conclusion in a completely new field of activity pushed me to the idea of returning to the IT profession, became the motivation to review the past experience, learn hard-skills in the modern world of Web technologies and the inspiration to resume my career, but already in the role of a practicing developer.

- [February 2012 â€” September 2013]: **Technical Project Manager at UNDEV**. I was providing full cycle of project managment within **Agile, Kanban, XP** approaches from scratch to the public release stage (up to 10 active projects simultaneously). Planning and allocating resources on projects, project managers and developers team of the company's branch in Ulyanovsk, meeting deadlines and timelines on a project. Designing the applications from short description with user stories or sometimes performing the required analisys of the old software interfaces and base with a team and then produced the necessary documentation to confirm project estimate. I was developing the application architecture and **UI/UX using sketches, UML** (mix of ER-, Class- and actors cases diagrams) by myself and only then confirm the requirements with developers team. So my job duties were not only the traditional managment but also business analytics, **UX/UI prototyping** and designing of all application approaches. As a technical manager I was assisting the account managers and product owners to handle with issues, resolving them and negotiating with customers and VIP clients, federal business representatives, for example, from Rostelecom, the Olympic Committee of the London 2012 and Sochi 2014 Olympics, Sheremetyevo airport, TechCrunch Moscow 2012-2013, HSBC bank in London. Have launched more than 10 public and even more in-house projects: mostly complex logic tech-based business applications with **Ruby, RubyOnRails, Node.JS,  React, Angular, Backbone, etc**, DevOps projects with **Redis, MongoDB, Cheff, Ansible, Vagrant**, supervised projects like the GitLab and Redmine integration and implementation. I was involved in creating an engineering culture, trained new employees in the basics of Web application development, hired and performed a lot of work in personal motivation and improving the soft skills of my subordinate employees.

Trained developers in best-practices of product design, integration and delivery, releases engineering, implementing necessary tools and practices. Performed weekly retrospectives of  issues and bugs records in the bug-tracking system to avoid them in the future perspective. As a head of the customer technical support team  I have performed some optimizations and improvements of work processes, training the moderators of the site in communications and customer relationship.

- [February 2008 - October 2009]: **Senior support engineer at ECHO (aboutecho.com, JS-Kit Inc)**. As part of the Scrum team of the startup project provided technical support to service customers in English including such Vip-clients as tech managers of the WashingtonPost and CNN, etc. In addition to the technical support and gathering information of the project issues I have created the first user FAQ. I worked with **HTML/xHTML/CSS3/DHTML/JavaScript(ES5)** widget implementation, development and manual testing on front-end practicing in **AJAX/XML/XMLHttpRequest/DOM-Objects/Websockets/etc** technologies, sometimes performing the necessary server tests on backend which was a cluster of more than 100 servers with real-time data replication. It was the most complex system in my career ever. The unique **Erlang/Ocaml/C++** code of platform allowed to process several billion requests per second, the best real-time rates at the time.

- [December 2006 - December 2008]: **Support engineer of Installation Team at X-Cart (x-cart.com)**. Provided customer technical support for X-Cart (first PHP-based ecommerce engine in the world) worldwide. Mastered in customer relationship, issue and conflict resolving. Most of working time I have been installing PHP-engine on **IIS, Apache, Nginx** servers, configuring client infrastructure, providing security audits and all the necessary server administration tasks.
